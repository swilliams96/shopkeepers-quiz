All questions are periodically regenerated from information on the [Dota 2 Gamepedia wiki](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dota_2_Wiki), which helps to this app relevant as the game is updated. Special thanks to the admins and community editors that help to keep the information on the wiki up to date, as projects like this one would not be possible without their hard work.

### Contributing
This project was primarily started to help teach myself various JavaScript frameworks, but feel free to contribute and help to improve the app!

This repo contains the front-end React.js code. If you would like to contirbute to the backend instead, the Express.js API and python scrapers (that collect the information from the wiki and generate the questions) are available in a separate repo at: [swilliams96/shopkeepers-quiz-server](https://github.com/swilliams96/shopkeepers-quiz-server/)
